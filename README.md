#Project Abstract
This document outlines an application that can be used in a few ways to track or plan out your
fitness activity. This application will allow you to plan out your gym schedule by the week and
track results. The user will be asked initially to log in if they have an account or sign up. The
user will be able to set exercises for Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and so on. If the user does
not feel the need to plan out their schedule, they may just track what they accomplish through
working out day to day. Also, the user shall be able to set new fitness goals to reach. From a user
point of view, the user will make an account and have the chance to log their activity. This is a
user-friendly application and is open to all users.

Conceptual Design
Upon opening the application, the user will be prompted to login in or create an account ideally.
The programming language will be Java and the database will be MySQL. The framework will
be coming from Spring Boot. The API will be made through HTML code. 

Background
This product will have a user-friendly interface upon opening the application. A user shall be
asked to login or create an account. After logging in or creating an account, the user will have
access to all the application’s features. One of the application's features is to set specific fitness
goals to be achieved in the future. Another feature allows the user to track their fitness
progression. The last feature is the ability to plan out your workouts for the 7-day week. One
comparison that I found is called “GymQuest” which is linked below:

I will be looking at this open-source project to gain pointers and inspiration. The contributors to
this project have everything that you would need for a fitness application. However, my project
will remain completely different as it is designed to be a web application while “GymQuest” is
for Androids. This project is inteded to be 100% free and open to anyone who would like to use it.
